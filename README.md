This repo will contain code for our Happy Helper App

## Description:
The primary purpose of Happy Helper is to provide assistance with everyday tasks to newly discharged hospital patients based on their needs. The current model allows the user to request a task to be performed by a volunteer helper. After the request has been made, the helper can accept the task based on day, time, location, and type of task to be performed.

## HISTORY AND MOTIVATION:
Our group member, Sean Bristol-Lee, has a history in the medical field, specifically Physical Therapy. 
In his experience, Sean noticed many patients would be discharged from the Hospital and then go home to busy family members or sometimes alone. So many patients needed help with simple everyday tasks such as:

1. Walking the dog
2. Basic housekeeping
3. Picking up groceries
4. Basic errands
5. And many others

Sean posed the idea to Osama, Naser, and Hawa and they agreed to pursue the idea of creating an app that would provide much solace and relief to newly discharged patients. There are also many people out there that have skill sets and free time that would love to give back in some way. The volunteer aspect of this app allows room for users to give and receive the help they need without money being a hindering or motivating factor.
